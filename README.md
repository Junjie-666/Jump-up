## General Information
This is a test heading.
An introductory parkour game built with MakeCode Arcade (Python). Practiced: character physics-based jumping, breaking down game progression, restarting after death, and phased difficulty (day → dusk → night).
Core mechanics: Press A to jump; during Day, adapt to ground obstacles; at Dusk, accelerate the pace; at Night, flying enemies appear and jump windows become tighter. Character dies upon collision with objects, displays score, and presses “A” to restart.

# Technologies Used：


## Features
Jump Physics and Ground Constraints，Press “A“to apply upward initial velocity. Gravity applies every frame. Upon landing, velocity resets to zero and remains at ground level.  
Phased Difficulty: Day → Dusk → Night 
Day: Introductory pace, ground obstacles  
Dusk: Faster respawns, more urgent movement  
Night: Adds flying enemies, restricts jump rhythm 
Scores are determined by survival time and gold coins collected. A “High score” is recorded upon character death.

## Setup




## Usage
Unify management of game physics, difficulty, and character states to enable subsequent modules to read and write operations.
GROUND_Y = 110
GRAVITY = 700
BASE_SPEED = -60
game_running = 0
high_score = 0
world_stage = -1
current_anim_frame = 0

Create character models, apply gravity, and ensure characters cannot fall below the ground plane.
